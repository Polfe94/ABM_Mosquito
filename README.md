# ABM_Mosquito
Agent based model for mosquito dispersal, zoonotic transmision and disease spread.

## TO DO
* Which data should we extract from the model? (positions, if infectious or not, distribution of bites per vector and host, ...)
* Which results to average across simulations?
* Parameter tunning
* Asymetric distribution of number of bites per vector
* Number of initially infectious individuals (vector or host)
